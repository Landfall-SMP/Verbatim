## Redistribution & Hosting

You are fully welcome to:
- Use this code on public or private servers
- Fork and modify it for personal, team, or server use
- Share compiled builds directly with others
- Include it in public or private modpacks

We only ask one thing:

> üôè Please do **not** reupload this mod or its forks to **Modrinth**, **CurseForge**, **Hangar**, **SpigotMC**, **MCMarket**, or similar public distribution platforms without prior permission.

This is not intended to limit collaboration or creativity. It is simply to avoid confusion, fragmented support, and diluted visibility for the official builds. If you wish to distribute a public fork, we encourage you to contact us.

This being said, we are accountable to the users of this code, including future ones. We consider it our responsibility to ensure this project remains accessible, even if we eventually move on. If we‚Äôre no longer maintaining the project and cannot be reached, treat this as permission to carry the work forward.
